There will be nine mole containers, which will all start out as empty slots. We will have some function run when the play button is clicked to start a timer to have a mole pop out. This will chnage the state of moleIn/out to true. A separate function will run after the state is set to true. Either that function or another click event will change the state back to false, which will possibly increment the score, but will also run the initial function again to change the moleIn/out to true.
